## Reward function

Definition from AWS

>The reward function describes immediate feedback (as a score for reward or penalty) when the vehicle takes an action to move from a given position on the track to a new position. Its purpose is to encourage the vehicle to make moves along the track to reach its destination quickly. The model training process will attempt to find a policy which maximizes the average total reward the vehicle experiences.

### Signature

```
def reward_function(params) :
    
    reward = ...

    return float(reward)
```

### Params

| Name                 | Description |
| :------------------- | :--------------|
| all_wheels_on_track  | (boolean) flag to indicate if the vehicle is on the track |
| x                    | (float) vehicle's x-coordinate in meters |
| y                    | (float) vehicle's y-coordinate in meters |
| distance_from_center | (float) distance in meters from the track center |
| is_left_of_center    | (boolean) flag to indicate if the vehicle is on the left side to the track center or not |
| heading              | (float) vehicle's yaw in degrees |
| progress             | (float) percentage of track completed |
| steps                | (int) numbers of steps completed |
| steering             | (float) -1 to 1 (-1 is right, 1 is left)                                            | speed                | (float) vehicle's speed in meters per second (m/s) |
| steering_angle       | (float) vehicle's steering angle in degrees |
| track_width          | (float) width of the track |
| waypoints            | [[float, float] â€¦ ] list of [x,y] as milestones along the track center |
| closest_waypoints    | [int, int] indices of the two nearest waypoints |
